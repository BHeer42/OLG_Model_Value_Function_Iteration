Chapter 9.1.2. from the book:

'Dynamic General Equilibrium Modeling: Computational Methods and Applications'
(2nd edition, 2009)

By Burkhard Heer and and Alfred Mau√üner 

--- Python Code: RCH91v.py

--- GAUSS Code: AK60_value.gss


The program is described in much more detail in our tutorial:

In order to run the Python program, you simply need to store the file in a directory and run it.

In order to run the GAUSS program AK60_value.gss, you also need to store the auxiliary files 'toolbox.src' and 'function.src' in the
same directory.
